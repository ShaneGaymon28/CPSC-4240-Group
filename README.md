# CPSC-4240-Group
This project was done as part of CPSC-4240 (System Admin and Security) at Clemson University.

## Description

For this project, we were asked to develop an open source tool (command-line or visual) that monitors system performance or network performance. We developed a system performance monitor with the following features:

  1. Application Usage Monitor
  2. System CPU Monitor
  3. System Memory Monitor
  
  

## Running the Program

Currently this app only supports Linux environments. 

Run the script by typing `python main.py`
